Potential threats include: climate change, land use change, pesticides, parasites, invasive species, and more. Multiple stressors can occur simultaneously and in synergy too. Much uncertainty remains about the relative importance of each stressor and their interactions. And essential monitoring data on the rates, geographic scope, ecological aspects, and taxonomic nature of wild bee population trends are scant.</p><img src=images/Bees_Impacts_Threats.png alt="Stressors to VT bee populations" style=width:90%;align:center></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=climate-change class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Climate Change</h2></header><section class=post-content><p>Increasing temperature and extreme weather are among the greatest long-term threats to biodiversity, with bees being no exception. The possible implications are nearly infinite, ranging from phenological mis-match to reduced overwintering survival from increased metabolism as a result of warmer winters. Some species, particularly generalists with long flight periods, are likely to thrive with longer growing seasons and less severe winters and additional southern species are likely to migrate into Vermont in coming decades. On the other hand, northern species and those closely tied to specific plants are likely to suffer.<br><br><img src=images/Bee_Climate_Sens.png alt=Vt_Bee_ClimateChange_sensitivity style=width:95%;height:21%></p><p class=caption>Climate change sensitivity of bees in Vermont.

Since bees are often described as solar-powered insects, and flower abundance is generally greater in open areas than mature forests, it&rsquo;s likely that reduced forest cover will be beneficial for some species. However, a distinct bee community inhabits forests and is easy to overlook, since much of the activity happens before leaf out in the spring. Forests are also important nesting sites for many species and may serve as buffers to the spread of invasive species and other anthropogenic threats. Forest fragmentation also has ripple effects with significant consequences for remaining vegetation. In particular, increased deer density and associated over-browsing is likely to reduce both the abundance and diversity of flowering plants. Several uncommon specialist bees (i.e. <i>Andrena cornelli</i>, <i>Macropis</i>, and <i>Andrena persimulata</i>) are dependent on flowers favored by deer, and thus will likely decline as ex-urban deer densities increase.</p><div class=row><div class=doubleColumn><div>In Vermont, continued urban sprawl, particularly in the bee-rich areas of western Chittenden County, is likely to be a major threat at both the local and regional scale. One such example noted during the duration of this project - a sandy, vacant field in Williston home to a number of uncommon bee species was replaced by a self-storage facility and is now a mix of pavement and turf grass. Similar sites around the state are being targeted for development, including for solar fields, which are often seeded with non-native grasses and mowed frequently. Increased human densities will also increase direct mortality through road kill, which is a largely unstudied, but is potentially a significant source of mortality.</div><div><img src="images/A. manicatum.jpg"></div></div><p>Agricultural intensification is a global conservation issue, with economic forces driving the consolidation and mechanization of agriculture, which generally reduces the biological diversity of farmland. An obvious example in Vermont is the dairy industry, the landscape was once dominated by small farms, many of which had much of their acreage in pasture. This pasture and fallow areas around the barns likely had an abundance of thistle, burdock, brambles, and other flowering plants that provided prime habitat for a number of uncommon, native bees. The larger dairy operations that dominate today are dependent on acres of corn and hay, both of which are often cultivated from edge to edge and largely devoid of bees. Pesticides, particularly broad spectrum, systemic insecticides such as neonicotinoids are a major concern of industrial agriculture.</p><p>Sandpits are one specific habitat that has the potential to be significantly degraded by development. Sandy soils in general support the greatest bee diversity but are also prime sites for new construction and other forms of development. Additional thoughts on this habitat appear elsewhere in this report.</p><p style=font-size:10pt;text-align:right;margin-right:3%><a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_LandingPage/>Home</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Current_Knowledge/>Current Knowledge</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Conservation/>Conservation</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Next_Steps/>Next Steps</a></p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=introduced--managed-species class='post last'><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Introduced & Managed Species</h2></header><section class=post-content><br><div class=lead><h4>~95% of the state is within the foraging range of a registered Honey Bee hive</h4></div><br><p>Introduced species are a major cause of biodiversity loss.

The vast majority of Honey Bees in Vermont live in managed hives, though they occasionally escape and establish colonies in natural settings or human structures. It is thought that very few of these feral hives are able to survive for multiple seasons. The effects of <i>Apis mellifera</i> and commercial <i>Bombus</i> hives on native species has been extensively studied with studies finding significant negative impacts on native bee populations.<p>Better education of beekeepers and potential beekeepers is also needed to limit the number of honey bee hives (especially poorly managed ones) on the landscape</p></div></div></div><div class=row><div class=doubleColumn><div>Other non-native bees such as the Horn-faced Mason (<i>Osmia cornifrons</i>), Taurus Orchard Bee (<i>Osmia taurus</i>), and Alfalfa Leafcutter (<i>Megachile rotundata</i>), that have been historically managed for pollination, have escaped and are likely affecting native species populations. Since agricultural bee management practices present a possible significant risk to local and regional bee populations they should be implemented with great caution, especially since most of Vermont’s pollinator mediated agriculture is relatively small scale, where wild bees may be sufficient and produce higher quality crops.<p>Additionally, habitat destruction from invasive species is a threat to many of the native plants that bees rely on, with non-native plants and earthworms being two major examples. Both of these can have drastic effects on plant communities and may also affect the quality of nesting sites (twigs, bare sand, river banks). The extent of these impacts is largely unstudied.</p></div><div><br><img alt=Non-native_bee_obs_VT src=images/PropIntroducedObservations_noBombus_noApis.png style=width:500px;height:500px><p class=caption>Proportion of non-native bee observations in Vermont.
