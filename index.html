Several causes have been proposed and are discussed below, but more research is needed to show what factors are driving any observed population declines. It&rsquo;s logical to assume that bees experience many of the same pressures as do our birds, plants, and other wildlife, the specifics of which vary immensely by species. In addition to availability of food, bee populations are also likely limited by disease, parasites, a lack of suitable nesting sites, exposure to toxic chemicals and a number of other human modifications to the landscape.</p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=introduced--managed-species class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Introduced & Managed Species</h2></header><section class=post-content><br><div class=lead><h4>Introduced species are a major cause of biodiversity loss for most taxa at all geographic scales.

Species of <i>Bombus</i> and the Western Honey Bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) are not included.</p></div><div>The effects of Honey Bees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) and commercial Bombus hives on native species has been extensively studied with many authors finding significant impacts (Meeus et al. 2011; Mallinger, Gaines-Day, and Gratton 2017). Other non-native bees such as Osmia cornifrons, Osmia taurus, and Megachile rotundata, that have been historically managed for pollination, have escaped and are likely affecting native species populations (LeCroy et al. 2020). Since these practices present a possible significant risk to local and regional bee populations they should be implemented with great caution, especially given that most of Vermont’s pollinator mediated agriculture is relatively small scale, where wild bees may be sufficient (Isaacs and Kirk 2010).<p>Observations of bee predation by non-native species in Vermont are limited, but the recent spread of Vespa crabro in the state presents a likely new threat (iNat) and several long-established species (i.e Dioctria hyalipennis, and Mantis religiosa) are likely predators of native bee species. No non-native cleptoparasitic bees are known from Vermont, but Coelioxys coturnix is rapidly spreading and now known from MA and CT (cite). It is likely that numerous parasitoids already established are not native (ie Monodontomerus obscurus) but much remains to be learned about the native range, hosts, and impacts of most bee-associated parasitoids.</p><p>Habitat destruction from invasive species is a threat to many of the native plants that bees rely on, and may also affect the quality of nesting sites (twigs, bare sand, river banks). The extent of these impacts is largely unstudied. Earthworms are one group of introduced species that are having a measurable impact on forest plant communities (cite?) with likely implications for many bee species, particularly the numerous spring ephemeral specialists.</p></div></div><p style=font-size:10pt;text-align:right;margin-right:3%><a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_LandingPage/>Home</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Current_Knowledge/>Current Knowledge</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Conservation/>Conservation</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Next_Steps/>Next Steps</a></p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=climate-change class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Climate Change</h2></header><section class=post-content><p>Increasing temperature and extreme weather are among the greatest long-term threats to biodiversity, with bees being no exception. The possible implications are nearly infinite, ranging from phenological mis-match to reduced overwintering survival from increased metabolism as a result of warmer winters. Some species, particularly generalists with long flight periods, are likely to thrive with longer growing seasons and less severe winters and additional southern species are likely to migrate into Vermont in coming decades.</p><p style=font-size:10pt;text-align:right;margin-right:3%><a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_LandingPage/>Home</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Current_Knowledge/>Current Knowledge</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Conservation/>Conservation</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Next_Steps/>Next Steps</a></p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=land-use-change class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Land Use Change</h2></header><section class=post-content><p>For the first time in over 150 years, the forest cover of New England has recently begun to shrink, driven largely by urban growth (Jeon et al. 2014). In Vermont, continued urban sprawl, particularly in the bee-rich areas of western Chittenden County, is likely to be a major threat at both the local and regional scale. One such example noted during the duration of this project - a sandy, vacant field in Williston with a number of uncommon bees was replaced by a self-storage facility where the remaining ground is now a mix of pavement and turf grass. Similar sites around the state are being targeted for development, including for solar fields, which are often seeded with non-native grasses and mowed frequently.</p><p>Though the total acreage of farmland in VT is Agricultural intensification is a global conservation issue, with economic forces driving the consolidation and mechanization of agriculture, which generally reduces the biological diversity of farmland. An obvious example in Vermont is the dairy industry, the landscape was once dominated by small farms, many of which had much of their acreage in pasture. This pasture and fallow areas around the barns likely had an abundance of thistle, burdock, brambles, and other flowering plants that were prime habitat for a number of uncommon, native bees. The larger dairy operations that dominate today are dependent on acres of corn and hay, both of which are often cultivated from edge to edge and largely devoid of bees.</p><p style=font-size:10pt;text-align:right;margin-right:3%><a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_LandingPage/>Home</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Current_Knowledge/>Current Knowledge</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Conservation/>Conservation</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Next_Steps/>Next Steps</a></p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=over-browsing class='post last'><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Over Browsing</h2></header><section class=post-content><p>Finally, increasing deer populations in ex-urban parts of the state provide a possible threat to native plant communities and the associated bees. Many understory forbs and shrubs are favorite food for deer and are disappearing from the forests with the highest deer densities. One species of particular concern is Andrena cornelli, which uses Rhododendron prinophyllum, an uncommon shrub (S-rank), that has been described as “deer candy” (Aaron Marcus, pers comm). Significant browse has also been noted on Fringed Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia ciliata</i>) and Red Osier Dogwood (<i>Cornus sericea</i>), both of which host species of conservation concern.</p><p style=font-size:10pt;text-align:right;margin-right:3%><a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_LandingPage/>Home</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Current_Knowledge/>Current Knowledge</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Conservation/>Conservation</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Next_Steps/>Next Steps</a></p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=inner><section class=copyright>© <a href=https://vtecostudies.org/>Vermont Center for Ecostudies</a></section><section></section><section><p style=text-align:center><b>Partners:</b><br></p><a href=https://vtfishandwildlife.com/ target=blank_><img src=images/VFW-Logo-RGB_transparent-background_0.png style=height:50px;width:50px></a>
