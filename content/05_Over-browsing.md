Finally, increasing deer populations in ex-urban parts of the state provide a possible threat to native plant communities and the associated bees. Many understory forbs and shrubs are favorite food for deer and are disappearing from the forests with the highest deer densities. One species of particular concern is Andrena cornelli, which uses Rhododendron prinophyllum, an uncommon shrub (S-rank), that has been described as “deer candy” (Aaron Marcus, pers comm). Significant browse has also been noted on Fringed Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia ciliata</i>) and Red Osier Dogwood (<i>Cornus sericea</i>), both of which host species of conservation concern.
