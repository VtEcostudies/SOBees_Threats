Introduced species are a major cause of biodiversity loss. For bees in Vermont, this threat can manifest through multiple pathways, including competition, pathogen spillover, habitat destruction, and direct predation.

The Western Honey Bee (<i>Apis melifera</i>) introduced from Europe hundreds of years ago as an agricultural animal, is the most extensively managed bee species in the world. The vast majority of Honey Bees in Vermont live in managed hives, though they occasionally escape and establish colonies in natural settings or human structures. It is thought that very few of these feral hives are able to survive for multiple seasons. The effects of <i>Apis mellifera</i> and commercial <i>Bombus</i> hives on native species has been extensively studied with studies finding significant negative impacts on native bee populations. 

Better education of beekeepers and potential beekeepers is also needed to limit the number of honey bee hives  (especially poorly managed ones) on the landscape

Other non-native bees such as the Horn-faced Mason (<i>Osmia cornifrons</i>), Taurus Orchard Bee (<i>Osmia taurus</i>), and Alfalfa Leafcutter (<i>Megachile rotundata</i>), that have been historically managed for pollination, have escaped and are likely affecting native species populations. Since agricultural bee management practices present a possible significant risk to local and regional bee populations they should be implemented with great caution, especially since most of Vermontâ€™s pollinator mediated agriculture is relatively small scale, where wild bees may be sufficient and produce higher quality crops. 

Additionally, habitat destruction from invasive species is a threat to many of the native plants that bees rely on, with non-native plants and earthworms being two major examples. Both of these can have drastic effects on plant communities and may also affect the quality of nesting sites (twigs, bare sand, river banks). The extent of these impacts is largely unstudied.
