Invasive and introduced species are a major cause of biodiversity loss. For bees in Vermont, this threat can manifest through multiple pathways, including competition, pathogen spillover, habitat alteration, and direct predation.

The Western Honey Bee was introduced from Europe hundreds of years ago as an agricultural animal and is the most extensively managed bee species in the world. The vast majority of Western Honey Bees in Vermont live in managed hives, though they occasionally escape and establish colonies in natural settings or human structures. It is thought that very few of these feral hives are able to survive for multiple seasons. The effects of Western Honey Bees and <a href=https://www.xerces.org/publications/petitions-comments/letter-to-aphis-ppq-follow-up-to-june-23-2014-bumble-bee-meeting>commercial bumble bee hives</a> on native species has been extensively studied with many finding significant negative impacts on native bee populations from competition and pathogen spillover.

Other non-native bees such as the Horn-faced Mason (<i>Osmia cornifrons</i>), Taurus Orchard Bee (<i>Osmia taurus</i>), and Alfalfa Leafcutter (<i>Megachile rotundata</i>), that have been historically managed for pollination services, have escaped and are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75566-9" target = "blank_"> likely affecting native bee populations</a>. Since agricultural bee management practices present a possible significant risk to local and regional bee populations they should be implemented with great caution, especially since most of Vermontâ€™s pollinator mediated agriculture is relatively small scale, where <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01823.x" target="blank_"> wild bees may be sufficient and produce higher quality crops</a>.


Additionally, habitat alterations from invasive species, such as earthworms and exotic plants, is a threat to some native plant communities and nesting sites that bees rely on. The extent of these impacts on bee populations has yet to be studied in detail.
