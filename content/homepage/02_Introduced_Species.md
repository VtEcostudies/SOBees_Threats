<h4> Introduced species are a major cause of biodiversity loss for most taxa at all geographic scales. For bees in Vermont, this threat can manifest through multiple pathways, including competition, pathogen spillover, habitat destruction, and direct predation.

The effects of Honey Bees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) and commercial Bombus hives on native species has been extensively studied with many authors finding significant impacts (Meeus et al. 2011; Mallinger, Gaines-Day, and Gratton 2017). Other non-native bees such as Osmia cornifrons, Osmia taurus, and Megachile rotundata, that have been historically managed for pollination, have escaped and are likely affecting native species populations (LeCroy et al. 2020). Since these practices present a possible significant risk to local and regional bee populations they should be implemented with great caution, especially given that most of Vermontâ€™s pollinator mediated agriculture is relatively small scale, where wild bees may be sufficient (Isaacs and Kirk 2010). 

Observations of bee predation by non-native species in Vermont are limited, but the recent spread of Vespa crabro in the state presents a likely new threat (iNat) and several long-established species (i.e Dioctria hyalipennis, and Mantis religiosa) are likely predators of native bee species. No non-native cleptoparasitic bees are known from Vermont, but Coelioxys coturnix is rapidly spreading and now known from MA and CT (cite). It is likely that numerous parasitoids already established are not native (ie Monodontomerus obscurus) but much remains to be learned about the native range, hosts, and impacts of most bee-associated parasitoids. 

Habitat destruction from invasive species is a threat to many of the native plants that bees rely on, and may also affect the quality of nesting sites (twigs, bare sand, river banks). The extent of these impacts is largely unstudied. Earthworms are one group of introduced species that are having a measurable impact on forest plant communities (cite?) with likely implications for many bee species, particularly the numerous spring ephemeral specialists.
