For the first time in over 150 years, the forest cover of New England has recently begun to shrink, driven largely by urban growth. Since bees are often described as solar-powered insects, and flower abundance is generally greater in open areas than mature forests, it's likely that reduced forest cover will be beneficial for some species. However, a distinct bee community inhabits forests and is easy to overlook, since much of the activity happens before leaf out in the spring. Forests are also important nesting sites for many species and may serve as buffers to the spread of invasive species and other anthropogenic threats. Forest fragmentation also has ripple effects with significant consequences for remaining vegetation. In particular, increased deer density and associated over-browsing is likely to reduce both the abundance and diversity of flowering plants. Several uncommon specialist bees (i.e. <i>Andrena cornelli</i>, <i>Macropis</i>, and <i>Andrena persimulata</i>) are dependent on flowers favored by deer, and thus will likely decline as ex-urban deer densities increase.

In Vermont, continued urban sprawl, particularly in the bee-rich areas of western Chittenden County, is likely to be a major threat at both the local and regional scale. One such example noted during the duration of this project -  a sandy, vacant field in Williston home to a number of uncommon bee species was replaced by a self-storage facility and is now a mix of pavement and turf grass. Similar sites around the state are being targeted for development, including for solar fields, which are often seeded with non-native grasses and mowed frequently. Increased human densities will also increase direct mortality through road kill, which is a largely unstudied, but is potentially a significant source of mortality.

Agricultural intensification is a global conservation issue, with economic forces driving the consolidation and mechanization of agriculture, which generally reduces the biological diversity of farmland. An obvious example in Vermont is the dairy industry, the landscape was once dominated by small farms, many of which had much of their acreage in pasture. This pasture and fallow areas around the barns likely had an abundance of thistle, burdock, brambles, and other flowering plants that provided prime habitat for a number of uncommon, native bees. The larger dairy operations that dominate today are dependent on acres of corn and hay, both of which are often cultivated from edge to edge and largely devoid of bees. Pesticides, particularly broad spectrum, systemic insecticides such as neonicotinoids are a major concern of industrial agriculture. 

Sandpits are one specific habitat that has the potential to be significantly degraded by development. Sandy soils in general support the greatest bee diversity but are also prime sites for new construction and other forms of development. Additional thoughts on this habitat appear elsewhere in this report.
