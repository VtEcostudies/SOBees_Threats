    For the first time in over 150 years, the forest cover of New England has recently declined, largely from urban growth. Since bees are often described as solar-powered insects, and flower abundance is generally greater in open areas than mature forests, it's likely that reduced forest cover will be beneficial for some species. However, a distinct bee community inhabits forests and is easy to overlook, since much of the activity happens before leaf out in the spring. Forests are also important nesting sites for many species and may serve as buffers to the spread of invasive species and other anthropogenic threats. Forest fragmentation also has ripple effects with significant consequences for remaining vegetation. In particular, increased deer density and associated over-browsing is likely to reduce both the abundance and diversity of flowering plants. Several uncommon specialist bees (i.e. Azalea Miner <i>Andrena cornelli</i>, Yellow Loosestrife Bees <i>Macropis</i>, and Northern Dogwood Miner <i>Andrena persimulata</i>) are dependent on flowers favored by deer, and may decline as exurban deer densities increase.

    Continued urban sprawl in Vermont, particularly in Chittenden County in areas of high bee diversity, is likely to be a major threat at both local and regional scales. One example happened during our surveys. Sandy soils generally support high bee diversity, but are often targeted for development. In Williston a sandy, vacant field that was a nesting site for a number of uncommon bee species was developed and is now covered with buildings, pavement, and turf grass. Similar sites around the state are being targeted for development, including for solar fields, which may be seeded with non-native grasses and mowed frequently. Direct mortality from vehicle strikes may be <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Desiree-Narango-2/publication/323459526_Roadside_habitat_impacts_insect_traffic_mortality/links/5d4d6c2d299bf1995b723667/Roadside-habitat-impacts-insect-traffic-mortality.pdf" target="blank_">a significant source of mortality</a> in some areas.
      
    Agricultural intensification is a global conservation issue, with economic forces driving the consolidation and mechanization of agriculture, which generally reduces the biological diversity of farmland. In Vermont, one particular group of bees that is likely threatened by the industrialization of agriculture (and development of former agricultural land) are the four thistle and burdock associated species, including the Texas Mason (<i>Osmia texana</i>), a watchlist species.</p>
