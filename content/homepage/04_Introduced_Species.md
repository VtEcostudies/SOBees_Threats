  <h4>About 95% of the state is within the foraging range of a registered Honey Bee hive</h4>

Invasive and introduced species are a major cause of biodiversity loss. For bees in Vermont, this threat can manifest through multiple pathways, including competition, pathogen spillover, habitat alteration, and direct predation.

    The Western Honey Bee was introduced from Europe hundreds of years ago as an agricultural animal and is the most extensively managed bee species in the world. The vast majority of Western Honey Bees in Vermont live in managed hives, though they occasionally escape and establish colonies in natural settings or human structures. It is thought that very few of these feral hives are able to survive for multiple seasons. The effects of Western Honey Bees and <a href=https://www.xerces.org/publications/petitions-comments/letter-to-aphis-ppq-follow-up-to-june-23-2014-bumble-bee-meeting>commercial bumble bee hives</a> on native species has been extensively studied with many finding significant negative impacts on native bee populations from competition and pathogen spillover.

    Pathogen spread or 'spillover' can occur when infected domestic bee hosts interact with closely-related wild bee populations. For example, commercially produced bumble bee colonies used for pollination in greenhouses often have higher levels of pathogens than wild bumble bees. These pathogens may spread to wild bees when <a href="https://www.pollinator.org/pollinator.org/assets/generalFiles/NAPPC-Clean-Stock-White-Paper.pdf" target="blank_"><u>commercial bees forage outside of greenhouses</u></a> and interact with local populations at nearby flowers. Additionally, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217822" target="blank_"><u>evidence of RNA viruses</u></a> spilling over from managed <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8400633/" target="blank_"><u>Western Honey Bees to wild bumble bees</u></a> has been found in Vermont and other regions. There may also be synergistic effects between other stressors and pathogens. For example, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2017.2181?rss=1" target="blank_"><u>a landscape-scale analysis</u></a> found that greater usage of the fungicide chlorothalonil was a strong predictor of pathogen prevalence in four declining bumble bee species. This fungicide has been commonly used during the last 20 years on golf courses and ornamental plants in Vermont. To understand the extent of the threat to bumble bees and other wild bees, the prevalence and effects on fitness of these pathogens are in urgent need of further study.

    Other non-native bees such as the Horn-faced Mason (<i>Osmia cornifrons</i>), Taurus Orchard Bee (<i>Osmia taurus</i>), and Alfalfa Leafcutter (<i>Megachile rotundata</i>), that have been historically managed for pollination services, have escaped and are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75566-9" target = "blank_"> likely affecting native bee populations</a>. Since agricultural bee management practices present a possible significant risk to local and regional bee populations they should be implemented with great caution, especially since most of Vermontâ€™s pollinator mediated agriculture is relatively small scale, where <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01823.x" target="blank_"> wild bees may be sufficient and produce higher quality crops</a>.
    </p>

    Additionally, habitat alterations from invasive species, such as earthworms and exotic plants, is a threat to some native plant communities and nesting sites that bees rely on. The extent of these impacts on bee populations has yet to be studied in detail.
