Increasing temperature and extreme weather are among the greatest long-term threats to biodiversity, with bees being no exception. The possible implications are nearly infinite, ranging from phenological mis-match to reduced overwintering survival from increased metabolism as a result of warmer winters. Some species, particularly generalists with long flight periods, are likely to thrive with longer growing seasons and less severe winters and additional southern species are likely to migrate into Vermont in coming decades. On the other hand, northern species and those closely tied to specific plants are likely to suffer.

Climate change will likely alter where bee species are found within the state. The graphic below illustrates how bee diversity may change given anticipated climatic conditions. We used climate envelope models to predict future distributions of 253 bee species using several greenhouse gas concentrations. Below, species richness predictions for 30-year intervals are shown assuming a moderate reduction from current greenhouse gas emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway; RCP 7.0). Use the sliding window below on the interactive graphic to explore how climate change may impact bee diversity across the state.
