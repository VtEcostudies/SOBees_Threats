Given that information about long-term population trends is nearly nonexistent, it's probably not surprising that very little empirical data are available that demonstrates causes of the declines we have identified. Several causes have been proposed and are discussed below, but more research is needed to show what factors are driving any observed population declines. It's logical to assume that bees experience many of the same pressures as do our birds, plants, and other wildlife, the specifics of which vary immensely by species. In addition to availability of food, bee populations are also likely limited by disease, parasites, a lack of suitable nesting sites, exposure to toxic chemicals and a number of other human modifications to the landscape.
