The population response by individual bee species is likely as varied as the potential causes. Potential threats include: climate change, land use change, pesticides, parasites, invasive species, and more. Multiple stressors can occur simultaneously and in synergy too. Much uncertainty remains about the relative importance of each stressor and their interactions. And essential monitoring data on the rates, geographic scope, ecological aspects, and taxonomic nature of wild bee population trends are scant.
